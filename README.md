# Derma-Skin App
 
Derma is a mobile application developed as part of the SE5104: Mini Project course module at Sabaragamuwa University. It aims to provide users with the tools and knowledge to identify skin conditions, receive preventive care advice, and access professional medical guidance.

<b>Motivation Behind Derma<br><br></b>
Skin diseases affect approximately one in three people worldwide (WHO). Despite the widespread nature of these issues, many avoid seeking medical advice due to time constraints, stigma, or lack of awareness about the seriousness of their conditions. From mild rashes to severe diseases such as skin cancer or STDs, undiagnosed issues can worsen over time. Derma was created to address this gap by providing an easy, accessible, and private platform for users to assess their skin health and take preventive measures.
